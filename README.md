## üîç Interactive API Documentation with Swagger UI

The application provides **Swagger UI** for interactive API documentation and testing. You can access it by navigating to the following URL in your browser: `http://localhost:<PORT>/swagger-ui/index.html`
- Replace `<PORT>` with the port number your application is running on (e.g., `8080`).
- Swagger UI allows you to:
  - Explore all available API endpoints.
  - Test endpoints with real requests and responses.
  - View detailed documentation for each endpoint, including request/response formats and constraints.

## üîç Alternative API Interaction with Postman

For those who prefer using **Postman** for API interaction, an exported Postman collection is provided. This collection contains all the necessary API endpoints and configurations for testing the **Ace X Two (1X2)** application.

### Steps to Use the Postman Collection:

1. **Locate the Collection**:
   - The Postman collection file is located at:
     ```
     ...\acextwo\AceXTwo.postman_collection.json
     ```

2. **Import the Collection into Postman**:
   - Open **Postman**.
   - Click on the **Import** button in the top-left corner.
   - Select the `AceXTwo.postman_collection.json` file from the specified location.
   - Click **Import** to add the collection to your Postman workspace.

3. **Configure the Environment**:
   - Ensure your Spring Boot application is running.
   - Set the base URL in Postman to match your application's server address (e.g., `http://localhost:8080`).

4. **Interact with the API**:
   - Use the imported collection to:
     - Test all available API endpoints.
     - Send requests and view responses.
     - Validate the functionality of the **Ace X Two (1X2)** application.

This Postman collection provides a convenient and powerful way to explore and test the API without using Swagger UI.
